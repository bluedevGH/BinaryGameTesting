[Function] createBinary (int: Number)
Outputs an array of true / false, to be the binary value of a number

Example:

console.log(createBinary()); s

Output:
[false, true, true, true, false, true, true, false]

(note that this is the binary value of the number 118)



[Function] randomiseBinaryFunc (Array: Binary Array)
This requires an array formatted from the previous function, createBinary. 
It returns another array in the same format. It's randomised between true / false, but will never equal to the array put in.

(useful for inputting random values when creating a row for a question)

Example:

myBinary = createBinary();
// creates a binary array, 8 values of true or false

myRandomisedBinary = randomiseBinaryFunc(myBinary);
console.log(myRandomisedBinary); // Will never equal myBinary



[Function] CreateQuestionButton (Int: Button number, Int: Question number, Bool: Binary Value)
Creates a button, with an id and a class. This is used to describe an x and y value.

Properties:
ID = Which button it is on the row (button 0-7)
Class = Question number (starts at 0, moves up)

WARNING: Recommended not to use on it's own, as it creates a singular button. It's used as part of addRow, and should keep to there.



[Function] createTextButton (Str: Internal value, Int: Question number)
Creates a div with the value of the Internal value, and gives it a class with question number
NOTE: Ensure Internal value is equal to "=" to create an equals box (NO SPACE). Any other value becomes an answer button)

Properties:
ID = "= div", or "ans div"
Class = Question number (starts at 0, moves up)

WARNING: Recommended not to use on it's own, as it creates a singular box. It's used as part of addRow, and should keep to there.



[Function] addRow (Array: Random Binary Array, Int: Actual Number)
Creates full row of 10 boxes, with 8 buttons, an "=" box and an "answer" box (with the int value of the final number to change to).

Example:

myBinary =
